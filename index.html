    <p>As a Customer Service Representative, I dealt with requests of WU customers, agents and employees via phone and email. I quickly took on the responsibilities of a Backup Team Leader. My duties included leading team meetings, handling internal employee surveys and performing management tasks. In April 2021 I got the full-time Quality Analyst position. It involved overseeing the performance of a group of Customer Service Representatives and delivery of feedback to them. My responsibilities also included teaching new hires, supporting all CSRs with process-related questions, creation of learning materials, revision of existing work practices, participation in management development training sessions, leading huddles, and so on. I was also a certified Master QA, which meant that on top of my usual tasks I trained QAs before they were officially certified.</p>
